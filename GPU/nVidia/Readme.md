### Nvidia FPS Limiter v3 对比 RTSS

Starting with [441.87](https://github.com/CHEF-KOCH/nVidia-modded-Inf/releases/tag/441.87) nVidia added their own FPS Limiter (v3) in the NV control panel. You might [ask yourself](https://youtu.be/W66pTe8YM2s) what are the differences between [RTSS](https://www.guru3d.com/files-details/rtss-rivatuner-statistics-server-download.html) and nVidia's solution and which solution should you prefer?

**Overall:**
- The frametime is more consistent with RTSS because this is how RTSS works.
- nVidia's solution does not allow you to change the frame rate without restarting the game, this works in RTSS. nVidia could fix or change that in the future.
- Every overlay you use, no matter what program will add a small delay!
- NVIDIA Inspector old limiter (v2) and AMDs Chill adding the most input delay.

**RTSS 优点:**
- _Nice_ 图形界面
- RTSS 设置 易于备份
- 小数位 限制 (用来减少 垂直同步 延迟) can be set, 没有其他工具可以做到
- 允许更改每一个游戏单独的设置
- RTSS 拥有全局设置, 和 单独的 exe 文件设置

**Cons:**
- Adds a frame of [input delay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs0PYCpBJjc), to workaround it use the default ("Global" profile)
- It's an separate third-party tool which needs to run in the background
- Can interfere with steam's overlay feature
- Can crash specific games, depending on the settings and used injection method
- Some games will not start while injecting the overlay into it
- Some games can detect the injection method as "cheat" and disconnect or at worst, ban you!

**nVidia Frame Limiter 优点:**
- 无需第三方程序! 最少的后台服务在运行.
- No per-game setting, you need to set the frame limit globally OR via the specific game profile which is a bit clunky

**Cons:**
- No _fancy_ GUI
- Not as advanced as RTSS
- Some games (once the limiter is enabled) having problems showing the in-game overlays


### FreeSync Gaming on Nvidia (Adaptive Sync)

Open the Nvidia Control Panel, browse to “Set up G-Sync”, then select your FreeSync monitor. From here, make sure both the “enable G-Sync, G-Sync compatible” checkbox and the “enable settings for the selected display model” checkbox are ticked. The second checkbox doesn’t appear if the monitor is G-Sync certified. Then click Apply, your monitor will restart and adaptive sync will be enabled.


### Control Panel and it's toggles

TweakGuides has a full documentation what each toggle/settings in the nVidia Control Panel (NVCP) does, I highly suggest that you read it before you touch any of the settings. The Guide constantly gets updates as soon nVidia changes something in the NVCP. The default settings are usually fine and you might only want to tweak the application/game settings related profiles, which you can do via the NVCP or [nVidia Inspector](https://github.com/DeadManWalkingTO/NVidiaProfileInspectorDmW) (unofficial utility).


### nVidia Shader Cache on a HDD

Shaders are loaded by the game itself, like any other of their assets, and sent to the driver for compilation (meaning transformed from source code form into binary form that can be used by the GPU.) The driver compiles them and sends the results back to the game. The compilation happens by the CPU, not the GPU, and is slow. A shader cache doesn't get rid of the loading-from-disk step. It only replaces the compilation step with a second loading step (loading the previously compiled form of the shader from disk and sending that to the game.) Even with a very slow disk, loading small already compiled shader files from said disk is much faster than generating them again. The shader cache is meant to persist between reboots. Putting them on a RAM disk meaning losing the cache on reboot - unless you're syncing the RAM disk to disk on reboot.

[jim2point0](https://www.deadendthrills.com/forum/discussion/504/how-to-custom-aspect-ratios-and-resolutions-via-dsr-nvidia-only) wrote an excellent guide how to _optimize_ nVidia's DSR via registry in order to get any resolution you want.
